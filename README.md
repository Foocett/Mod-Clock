# Overview
This is a clock designed to graphically display Holland Hall's six-day 18-mod schedule.
This clock consists of three main pages; the clock (/clock), the configuration page (/config), 
and the admin page (/admin)  
I have intentionally added very detailed documentation to most aspects of this project, and 
will keep it open source for future classes to learn from and/or modify, especially in the case
that the schedule changes in some way

The project is running on a version Raspberry Pi 5 running Raspberry Pi OS, a lightweight
debian-based operating system designed for the raspberry pi. A more detailed list of all the 
hardware can be found in the [hardware](#hardware) section of this document.

The software for this project is a Node.js app that primarily uses the Express and Socket.io 
frameworks, more information about these can be found in the [software](#software) section  

I have left educational and referential resources that can be found in the [resources](#resources) section,
while some of these are general, the majority of them are in reference to specific section(s) of code, which will
all contain a comment like this.
